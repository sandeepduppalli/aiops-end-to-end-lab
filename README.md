# End-to-End AIOps Lab  
**Prometheus · ML Anomaly Detection · Correlation · Auto-Remediation Gates**

This repository contains a complete, hands-on **AIOps implementation** built using open-source tooling.  
It demonstrates how modern observability data can be used to **detect anomalies, correlate signals, perform RCA, and safely trigger automation decisions**.

This project focuses on **decision intelligence and safety-first automation**, not blind auto-fixes.

---

## 🚀 What This Project Demonstrates

- Application metrics instrumentation
- Prometheus-based monitoring
- ML-driven anomaly detection
- Correlated alerting
- Root Cause Analysis (RCA) via dashboards
- Episode timelines (incident lifecycle)
- Auto-remediation **decision gates**
- Closed-loop automation via Alertmanager webhooks (simulated)

## 🔑 Key AIOps Concepts Covered

- Behavioral anomaly detection (time series)
- Event correlation across metrics
- RCA using signal timelines
- Noise reduction via adaptive alerting
- Separation of decision and execution layers
- Safety-gated automation

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project **simulates auto-remediation safely**.  
No destructive or production-impacting actions are executed.

---

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Python 3.9+
- Git

---

## ▶️ Quick Start (Recommended)

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sandeepduppalli/aiops-end-to-end-lab.git
cd aiops-end-to-end-lab

Start the full stack:

docker compose up

This will start:

Sample application

Prometheus

Alertmanager

Then start supporting services:

# ML anomaly exporter
python3 ml/ml_exporter.py

# Automation webhook (simulated remediation)
python3 automation/receiver.py

Access Points

Application metrics: http://localhost:5000/metrics

Prometheus UI: http://localhost:9090

Alertmanager UI: http://localhost:9093

Generate Load (Testing)
while true; do
  curl -s http://localhost:5000/ > /dev/null &
  sleep 0.05
done


Use Prometheus dashboards and /alerts page to observe:

Anomaly detection

Correlation

Alert lifecycle

Auto-remediation eligibility

# 3️⃣ Add “Example Screenshots” Text (Without Images)

Add this section next — it works even **before** you upload actual images.

## **Example Screenshots (What to Expect)**

```markdown
## 📊 Example Screenshots (Conceptual)

During testing, you should observe:

### 1. Anomaly Score Panel
- Flat baseline during normal traffic
- Sharp spike during abnormal behavior
- Gradual decay during recovery

### 2. Episode Timeline
- Traffic increases first
- Anomaly score reacts next
- Errors appear afterward
- Alert transitions: inactive → pending → firing → resolved

### 3. RCA Summary
- Traffic-driven incidents
- Error amplification under load
- Latency impact (when applicable)

### 4. Automation Logs
- Auto-remediation approval logged only when safety gates pass
- No action logged for high-risk scenarios
