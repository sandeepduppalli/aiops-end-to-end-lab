# End-to-End AIOps Lab (Prometheus + ML + Automation)

This repository contains a complete, hands-on AIOps implementation built step by step using open-source tools.

## What this project demonstrates

- Application metrics instrumentation
- Prometheus-based monitoring
- ML-driven anomaly detection
- Correlated alerting
- Root Cause Analysis (RCA) using dashboards
- Episode timelines
- Auto-remediation decision gates
- Closed-loop automation using Alertmanager webhooks

This project focuses on **decision intelligence and safety**, not blind automation.
